 *         respective dimension provided at tensor creation. All _inputs_ and _outputs_ tensors
 *         must have the same batch multiple.
 *       - Dynamic output dimensions: An _outputs_ tensor Qnn_TensorV1_t _dimensions_ field, if
 *         non-null, can vary after graph execution. As determined by the op definition, non-batch
 *         dimensions may be less than the respective dimension at tensor creation.
 *       - Dynamic dimensions: If an _inputs_ tensor was created with a non-null Qnn_TensorV2_t
 *         _isDynamicDimensions_ field, the corresponding dynamic dimensions must be provided by
 *         the caller. If an _outputs_ tensor was created with a non-null Qnn_TensorV2_t

 *         with as much data as possible.
 *       - Other fields like _dataType_ can also be permitted to change between invocations to
 *         QnnGraph_execute()/QnnGraph_executeAsync() for certain ops that perform data type
 *         conversions.
 *       - Some backends may be able to execute a graph with no _inputs_ provided the graph has no
 *         application-writable tensors.
 *       - Graph I/O Tensors marked optional (i.e. omitted or marked as type=QNN_TENSOR_TYPE_NULL
 *         during QnnGraph_addNode()) cannot be supplied to
 *         QnnGraph_execute()/QnnGraph_executeAsync(). Clients mark tensors to be of type

 *       - Mixing different tensor versions in the same graph (e.g. Qnn_TensorV1_t and
